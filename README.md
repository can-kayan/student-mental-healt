# Machine Learning Model Comparison with Student Mental Health Data Set & Data Analysis


## Usage

1. **Clone the warehouse:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kullanici-adiniz/machine-learning-model-comparison.git
    cd machine-learning-model-comparison
    ```

2. **Install the requirements:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. **`oopProject_studentsMentalHealt.ipynb` or `spyder_oop_data_analysis_with artificial_intelligence.py` file and follow the instructions to compare the machine learning models.**

## Models

The following models were implemented and compared:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Means Clustering

## Results
- The results and comparisons of the data analysis and the models created using the dataset on students' mental illness were saved in the 'grafikler' file. The graphical values of the data in this data set are also included in this file

## Note
You can see the libraries used by typing the following command in a cell in Jupyter Notebook
 ```bash
  !pip freeze
 ```
