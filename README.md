# Machine Learning Model Comparison

##Usage

1. **Clone the warehouse:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kullanici-adiniz/machine-learning-model-comparison.git
    cd machine-learning-model-comparison
    ```

2. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. **`oopProject_studentsMentalHealt.ipynb` or `spyder_oop_data_analysis_with artificial_intelligence.py` file and follow the instructions to compare the machine learning models.**

## Models

The following models were implemented and compared:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Means Clustering

## Results
- The model comparisons are shown on the screen with various graphs.

## Note
You can see the libraries used by typing the following command in a cell in Jupyter Notebook
 ```bash
  !pip freeze
 ```
